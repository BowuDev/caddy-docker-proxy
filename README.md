# CADDY-DOCKER-PROXY [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lucaslorentz/caddy-docker-proxy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lucaslorentz/caddy-docker-proxy)

## Introduction
This plugin enables caddy to be used as a reverse proxy for Docker.

## How does it work?
It scans Docker metadata looking for labels indicating that the service or container should be exposed on caddy.

Then it generates an in memory Caddyfile with website entries and proxies directives pointing to each Docker service DNS name or container IP.

Every time a docker object changes, it updates the Caddyfile and triggers a caddy zero-downtime reload.

## Basic labels
To expose a service or container inside caddy configuration, you just need to add labels starting with caddy.

Those are three main labels that configures the basic behavior of the proxying:

| Label | Example | Description |
| - | - | - |
| caddy.address | service.example.com | addresses that should be proxied separated by whitespace |
| caddy.targetport | 80 | the port being server by container |
| caddy.targetpath | /api | the path being served by container |

When added to a service, the values above will generate the following caddy configuration:
```
service.example.com {
	proxy / servicedns:80/api
}
```

### Usage examples
Proxying domain root to container root
```
caddy.address=service.example.com
caddy.targetport=80
```

Proxying domain root to container path
```
caddy.address=service.example.com
caddy.targetport=80
caddy.targetpath=/my-path
```

Proxying domain path to container root
```
caddy.address=service.example.com/path1
caddy.targetport=80
```

Proxying domain path to container path
```
caddy.address=service.example.com/path1
caddy.targetport=80
caddy.targetpath=/path2
```

Proxying multiple domains to container
```
caddy.address=service1.example.com service2.example.com
caddy.targetport=80
```
## More labels
Any other label prefixed with caddy, will also be converted to caddyfile configuration based on the following rules:

Label's keys are transformed into a directive and its value becomes the directive arguments. Example:
```
caddy.directive=valueA valueB
```
Generates:
```
directive valueA valueB
```

Dots represents nested directives. Example:
```
caddy.directive=argA
caddy.directive.subdirA=valueA
caddy.directive.subdirB=valueB1 valueB2
```
Generates:
```
directive argA {
	subdirA valueA
	subdirB valueB1 valueB2
}
```

Labels for parent directives are not required. Example:
```
caddy.directive.subdirA=valueA
```
Generates:
```
directive {
	subdirA valueA
}
```

Labels with empty values generates directives without arguments. Example:
```
caddy.directive=
```
Generates:
```
directive
```

It's possible to add directives to the automatically created proxy directive. Example:
```
caddy.proxy.websocket=
```
Generates:
```
service.example.com {
	proxy / servicedns:80/api {
		websocket
	}
}
```

Any _# suffix on labels is removed when generating caddyfile configuration, that allows you to write repeating directives. Example:
```
caddy.directive_1=value1
caddy.directive_2=value2
```
Generates:
```
directive value1
directive value2
```

## Multiple caddyfile sections from one service/container
It's possible to generate multiple caddyfile sections for the same service/container by suffixing the caddy prefix with _#. That's usefull to expose multiple service ports at different urls.

For example:
```
caddy_0.address = portal.example.com
caddy_0.targetport = 80
caddy_1.address = admin.example.com
caddy_1.targetport = 81
```
Generates:
```
portal.example.com {
	proxy / servicedns:80
}
admin.example.com {
	proxy / servicedns:81
}
```

## Docker images
Docker images are available at Docker Registry:
https://hub.docker.com/r/lucaslorentz/caddy-docker-proxy/

## Caddy CLI
All flags and environment variables supported by Caddy CLI are also supported:
https://caddyserver.com/docs/cli

Check **examples** folder to see how to set them on a docker compose file.

## Connecting to Docker Host
The default connection to docker host varies per platform:
* At Unix: `unix:///var/run/docker.sock`
* At Windows: `npipe:////./pipe/docker_engine`

You can modify docker connection using the following environment variables:

* **DOCKER_HOST**: to set the url to the docker server.
* **DOCKER_API_VERSION**: to set the version of the API to reach, leave empty for latest.
* **DOCKER_CERT_PATH**: to load the tls certificates from.
* **DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY**: to enable or disable TLS verification, off by default.

## Volumes
On a production docker swarm cluster, it's **very important** to store Caddy folder on a persistent storage. Otherwise Caddy will re-issue certificates every time it is restarted, exceeding let's encrypt quota.

To do that map a docker volume to `/root/.caddy` folder.

Since Caddy version 0.10.11, it is possible to run multiple caddy instances sharing same certificates.

For resilient production deployments, use multiple caddy replicas and map a`/root/.caddy` folder to a volume that supports multiple mounts, like Network File Sharing docker volumes plugins.

[Here is an example](examples/efs-volume.yaml) of compose file with replicas and persistent volume using  Rexray EFS Plugin for AWS.

## Trying it

Clone this repository.

Deploy the compose file to swarm cluster:
```
docker stack deploy -c examples/demo.yaml caddy-docker-demo
```

Wait a bit for services startup...

Now you can access both services using different urls
```
curl -H Host:whoami0.example.com http://localhost:2015

curl -H Host:whoami1.example.com http://localhost:2015
```

After testing, delete the demo stack:
```
docker stack rm caddy-docker-demo
```

## Building it
You can use our caddy build wrapper **build.sh** and include additional plugins on https://github.com/lucaslorentz/caddy-docker-proxy/blob/master/main.go#L5

Or, you can build from caddy repository and import  **caddy-docker-proxy** plugin on file https://github.com/mholt/caddy/blob/master/caddy/caddymain/run.go :
```
import (
  _ "github.com/lucaslorentz/caddy-docker-proxy/plugin"
)
```
